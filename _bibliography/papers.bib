  abstract={Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are crucial in genetics for predicting individual susceptibility to complex diseases by aggregating the effects of numerous genetic variants. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized our ability to detect rare and even de novo variants, creating an exciting opportunity for developing new PRS methods that can effectively leverage rare variants and capture the complex relationships among different variants. Furthermore, regulatory mechanisms play a crucial role in gene expression and disease manifestation, offering avenues to further enhance the performance and interpretation of PRS predictions. Through simulation studies, we highlighted aspects where current PRS methods face challenges when applied to WGS data, aiming to shed light on potential opportunities for further improvement. To address these challenges, we developed Epi-PRS, an approach that leverages the power of genomic large language models (LLM) to impute epigenomic signals across diverse cellular contexts, for use as intermediate variables between genotype and phenotype. A pretrained LLM is employed to transform genotypes into epigenomic signals using personal diploid sequences as inputs, and the genetic risk is then estimated based on the imputed personal epigenomic signals. Epi-PRS enhances the assessment of personal variant impacts, enabling a comprehensive and holistic consideration of genotypic and regulatory information within large genomic regions. Our simulation results demonstrated that incorporating the nuanced effects of non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory information can provide more precise PRS prediction and better understanding of genetic risk. Applying Epi-PRS to real data from the UK Biobank, our results further showed that Epi-PRS significantly outperforms existing PRS methods in two major diseases: breast cancer and diabetes. This study suggests that PRS methods can benefit from incorporating non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory information, highlighting the potential for significant advancements in disease risk modeling and enhancing the understanding of precision medicine.},

  journal={Nature Communications},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Identifying cis-regulatory elements (CREs) within non-coding genomic regions-such as enhancers, silencers, promoters, and insulators-is pivotal for elucidating the intricate gene regulatory mechanisms underlying complex biological traits. The current prevalent sequence-based methods often focus on singular CRE types, limiting insights into cell-type-specific biological implications. Here, we introduce CREATE, a multimodal deep learning model based on the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder framework, designed to extract discrete CRE embeddings and classify multiple CRE classes using genomic sequences, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin interaction data. CREATE excels in accurate CRE identification and exhibits strong effectiveness and robustness. We showcase CREATE's capability in generating comprehensive CRE-specific feature spectrum, offering quantitative and interpretable insights into CRE specificity. By enabling large-scale prediction of CREs in specific cell types, CREATE facilitates the recognition of disease- or phenotype-related biological variabilities of CREs, thereby expanding our understanding of gene regulation landscapes.},

  title={Associating genotype to imaging and clinical phenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease by leveraging genomic large language model},
  journal={Nature Aging},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) phenotypes. However, how these variants contribute to the etiology of AD remains largely elusive. Recent advances in genomic large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized regulatory genomic prediction tasks, offering new opportunities to interpret the genetic variation observed in personal genome. In this study, we propose epiBrainLLM, a novel computational framework that leverages genomic LLM to enhance our understanding of the causal pathways from genotypes to brain measures to AD-related clinical phenotypes. Our framework will first convert the personal DNA sequence into a diverse set of genomic and epigenomic features using a pretrained genomic LLM and then use these features to further predict phenotypes. Across various experimental settings, our results demonstrate that incorporating pretrained genomic LLMs significantly improves association analysis compared to using genotype information alone. We conclude that our proposed framework provides a novel perspective for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying the AD disease etiology, potentially offering insights into complex disease mechanisms beyond AD.},

  journal={IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are critical blueprints for understanding gene regulation and the intricate interactions that drive biological processes. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data in GRN inference, offering unprecedented insights into how chromatin accessibility plays an important part in gene regulation. However, existing methods often fall short in providing a quantitative and holistic depiction of regulatory relationships, particularly in capturing the strength, direction, and type of gene regulation simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging genetically perturbed scATAC-seq data to infer more comprehensive and accurate GRNs. Our method advances the field by integrating pre- and post-perturbation chromatin accessibility data, enabling the construction of GRNs that more accurately reflect the dynamic regulatory landscape. Through rigorous evaluation on seven real datasets, we demonstrate the method’s superior performance in reconstructing GRNs with enhanced precision and interpretability. This work significantly contributes to the field by providing a robust framework for GRN inference, with broad implications for understanding gene regulation in complex biological systems.},

  year={2024},
  abstract={The transformer-based models, such as GPT-31 and DALL-E2, have achieved unprecedented breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing and computer vision. The inherent similarities between natural language and biological sequences have prompted a new wave of inferring the grammatical rules underneath the biological sequences. In genomic study, it is worth noting that DNA sequences alone cannot explain all the gene activities due to epigenetic mechanism. To investigate this problem, we propose EpiGePT, a new transformer-based language pretrained model in epigenomics, for predicting genome-wide epigenomic signals by considering the mechanistic modeling of transcriptional regulation. Specifically, EpiGePT takes the context-specific activities of transcription factors (TFs) into consideration, which could offer deeper biological insights comparing to models trained on DNA sequence only. In a series of experiments, EpiGePT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in a diverse epigenomic signals prediction tasks as well as new prediction tasks by fine-tuning. Furthermore, EpiGePT is capable of learning the cell-type-specific long-range interactions through the self-attention mechanism and interpreting the genetic variants that associated with human diseases. We expect that the advances of EpiGePT can shed light on understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms in gene regulation.

  year={2024},
  abstract={The relationship between genetic variation and human phenotypes is crucial for developing effective treatments and personalized medicine. However, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which variants influence human traits and diseases is far from complete. Context-specific regulatory network is a typical tool that provides detailed understanding of gene regulation in specific biological contexts, allowing us to identify key regulators and pathways that are important for a particular phenotype. In this review, we summarize the large international biobanks and reference omics data that provide diverse datasets for the genotypephenotype analysis and the construction of context-specific regulatory networks, and discuss the importance of context-specific regulatory networks in explaining the underlying causal mechanism between genotypes and phenotypes. We emphasize the significance of QTL studies in explaining the correlation between genotypes and omics features, and present various computational approaches for the construction of context-specific regulatory networks. With continued advancements in biobanking, genomics, and computational biology, the context-specific regulatory networks may serve as an increasingly powerful tool for modeling the causal mechanisms that underlie the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes.},

Computational approaches are in urgent need to comprehensively analyze the sparse and heterogeneous single cell Hi-C data.

Among various chromatin conformation capture methods, HiChIP has received increasing attention for its significant improvement over other methods in profiling of regulatory (e.g. H3K27ac) and structural (e.g. cohesin) interactions. To facilitate the studies of 3D regulatory interactions, we developed a HiChIP interactions database, HiChIPdb (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/hichipdb/). The current version of HiChIPdb contains ∼262M annotated HiChIP interactions from 200 high-throughput HiChIP samples across 108 cell types. The functionalities of HiChIPdb include: (i) standardized categorization of HiChIP interactions in a hierarchical structure based on organ, tissue and cell line and (ii) comprehensive annotations of HiChIP interactions with regulatory genes and GWAS Catalog SNPs. To the best of our knowledge, HiChIPdb is the first comprehensive database that utilizes a unified pipeline to map the functional interactions across diverse cell types and tissues in different resolutions. We believe this database has the potential to advance cutting-edge research in regulatory mechanisms in development and disease by removing the barrier in data aggregation, preprocessing, and analysis.},

  abstract={Gene regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, etc., control transcriptional programs in a spatiotemporal manner. Though these elements are known to be able to induce either positive or negative transcriptional control, the community has been mostly studying enhancers which amplify transcription initiation, with less emphasis given to silencers which repress gene expression. To facilitate the study of silencers and the investigation of their potential roles in transcriptional control, we developed SilencerDB (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/silencerdb/), a comprehensive database of silencers by manually curating silencers from 2300 published articles.

The functionality of SilencerDB includes (a) standardized categorization of silencers in a tree-structured class hierarchy based on species, organ, tissue and cell line and (b) comprehensive annotations of silencers with the nearest gene and potential regulatory genes. SilencerDB, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive database at this scale dedicated to silencers, with reliable annotations and user-friendly interactive database features.

In this work, we introduce DC3 (De-Convolution and Coupled-Clustering) as a method for the joint analysis of various bulk and single-cell data such as HiChIP, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from the same heterogeneous cell population. DC3 can simultaneously identify distinct subpopulations, assign single cells to the subpopulations (i.e., clustering) and de-convolve the bulk data into subpopulation-specific data.

  abstract={Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of genomic loci potentially associated with hundreds of complex traits in the past decade. Nevertheless, the fact that more than 90% of such disease-associated variants lie in non-coding DNA with unknown functional implications has been appealing for advanced analysis of plenty of genetic variants. Toward this goal, recent studies focusing on individual non-coding variants have revealed that complex diseases are often the consequences of erroneous interactions between enhancers and their target genes. However, such enhancer-disease associations are dispersed in a variety of independent studies, and thus far it is still difficult to carry out comprehensive downstream analysis with these experimentally supported enhancer-disease associations. To fill in this gap, we collected experimentally supported associations between complex diseases and enhancers and then developed a manually curated database called EnDisease (http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/endisease/). Concretely, EnDisease documents 535 associations between 133 diseases and 454 enhancers, extracted from 199 articles. Moreover, after annotating these enhancers using 649 human and 115 mouse DNase-seq experiments, we find that cancer-related enhancers tend to be open across a large number of cell types. This database provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching, and it also allows users to download data freely. EnDisease has the potential to become a helpful and important resource for researchers who aim to understand the molecular mechanisms of enhancers involved in complex diseases.}

In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that scGraph is accurate and outperforms eight comparison methods in the task of cell-type identification.

Indeed, the fact that the majority of discovered loci fall into noncoding regions without clear links to genes has been preventing the characterization of their functions and appealing for a sophisticated approach to bridge genetic and genomic studies. Towards this problem, network-based prioritization of candidate genes, which performs integrated analysis of gene networks with GWAS data, has emerged as a promising direction and attracted much attention. However, most existing methods overlook the sparse and noisy properties of gene networks and thus may lead to suboptimal performance. Motivated by this understanding, we proposed a novel method called REGENT for integrating multiple gene networks with GWAS data to prioritize candidate genes for complex diseases. We leveraged a technique called the network representation learning to embed a gene network into a compact and robust feature space, and then designed a hierarchical statistical model to integrate features of multiple gene networks with GWAS data for the effective inference of genes associated with a disease of interest. We applied our method to six complex diseases and demonstrated the superior performance of REGENT over existing approaches in recovering known disease-associated genes. We further conducted a pathway analysis and showed that the ability of REGENT to discover disease-associated pathways. We expect to see applications of our method to a broad spectrum of diseases for post-GWAS analysis. REGENT is freely available at https://github.com/wmmthu/REGENT.}

  abstract={We fill this gap by addressing the problem of chromatin accessibility prediction with a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with k-mer embedding. We first split DNA sequences into k-mers and pre-train k-mer embedding vectors based on the co-occurrence matrix of k-mers by using an unsupervised representation learning approach. We then construct a supervised deep learning architecture comprised of an embedding layer, three convolutional layers and a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) layer for feature learning and classification. We demonstrate that our method gains high-quality fixed-length features from variable-length sequences and consistently outperforms baseline methods. We show that k-mer embedding can effectively enhance model performance by exploring different embedding strategies. We also prove the efficacy of both the convolution and the BLSTM layers by comparing two variations of the network architecture. We confirm the robustness of our model to hyper-parameters by performing sensitivity analysis. We hope our method can eventually reinforce our understanding of employing deep learning in genomic studies and shed light on research regarding mechanisms of chromatin accessibility.}
