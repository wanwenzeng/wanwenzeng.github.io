# I am **Wanwen Zeng**, currently a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University's Department of Statistics, working with Prof. Wing Hung Wong.

My research focuses on integrating statistical genetics, machine learning, and multi-omics data to unravel gene regulation mechanisms and their impact on complex traits and diseases. Specifically, I am interested in:

- **Developing novel methods** for deciphering gene regulation networks, with a focus on the interactions between non-coding elements, transcription factor (TF) networks, and their roles in disease mechanisms, particularly in the context of personal gene expression and allele-specific expression.

- **Advancing polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction** by leveraging whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, incorporating regulatory epigenomic signals, rare variants, and non-linear models, with an interest in improving prediction performance for individuals from diverse and admixed populations.

- **Utilizing large-scale genomic datasets and deep learning models** for causal inference, especially in distinguishing disease-causal genes from disease-responsive genes and understanding the effects of genetic variants on regulatory elements in disease progression.

I received my PhD from Tsinghua University, including a one-year research position at Stanford. Prior to my postdoctoral work, I was an assistant professor at Nankai University. My work aims to leverage cutting-edge computational and statistical tools to advance our understanding of genetic regulation in health and disease.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing the `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
