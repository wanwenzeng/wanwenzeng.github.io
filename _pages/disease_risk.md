## `Advancing disease risk assessment`

Advancing disease risk assessment has been greatly enhanced by the unprecedented opportunities provided by WGS data, which allows for the comprehensive inclusion of both rare and de novo variants. I develop methods that leverage WGS data from large biobanks such as UK Biobank and MVP, utilizing LLMs to integrate both regional and regulatory information. These LLMs enable more precise modeling of how genetic variants contribute to disease risk, offering deeper biological insights. By incorporating rare and de novo variants, our approach significantly improves the predictive performance and biological interpretability of polygenic risk scores, further advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture of disease.

**`Data Type`**: ATCT-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, WGS, phenotype (binary and continuous)
