I am Wanwen Zeng, currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University, working under the mentorship of Prof. Wing Hung Wong.

My research focuses on integrating machine learning, multi-omics and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data to uncover gene regulatory mechanisms and their implications for complex traits and diseases. Specifically, I am interested in:

- **Deciphering gene regulatory networks**, with an emphasis on non-coding regulatory elements and their interactions, particularly their roles in gene expression and disease mechanisms by leveraging large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets from ENCODE and ROADMAP.
  
- **Improving understanding of gene regulation in individual-level**, particularly predicting the effects of genetic variants on personal gene expression by utilizing large language models (LLMs) and the use of WGS data from admixed populations (e.g., African-American) in GTEx project.
  
- **Advancing disease risk assessment** with a focus on regulatory epigenomic signals, as well as rare and de novo variants by using biobank-level WGS data from UK Biobank and MVP.
  
I received my PhD from Tsinghua University, including a one-year research stint at Stanford. Before my postdoctoral role, I served as an assistant professor at Nankai University. My work aims to leverage state-of-the-art computational tools to deepen our understanding of gene regulation in both health and disease contexts.
