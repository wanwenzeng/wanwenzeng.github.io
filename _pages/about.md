I am **Wanwen Zeng**, currently a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University's Department of Statistics, working with Prof. Wing Hung Wong.

My research focuses on integrating statistical genetics, machine learning, and multi-omics data to unravel gene regulation mechanisms and their impact on complex traits and diseases. Specifically, I am interested in:

- **Developing novel methods** for deciphering gene regulation networks, with a focus on the interactions between non-coding elements, transcription factor (TF) networks, and their roles in disease mechanisms, particularly in the context of personal gene expression and allele-specific expression.

- **Advancing polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction** by leveraging whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, incorporating regulatory epigenomic signals, rare variants, and non-linear models, with an interest in improving prediction performance for individuals from diverse and admixed populations.

- **Utilizing large-scale genomic datasets and deep learning models** for causal inference, especially in distinguishing disease-causal genes from disease-responsive genes and understanding the effects of genetic variants on regulatory elements in disease progression.

I received my PhD from Tsinghua University, including a one-year research position at Stanford. Prior to my postdoctoral work, I was an assistant professor at Nankai University. My work aims to leverage cutting-edge computational and statistical tools to advance our understanding of genetic regulation in health and disease.
