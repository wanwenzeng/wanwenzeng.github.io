I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, working under the mentorship of [Prof. Wing Hung Wong](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/wing-hung-wong). My research focuses on developing machine learning methods to uncover gene regulatory mechanisms and their implications for complex traits and diseases by integrating multi-omics and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Specifically, I am interested in:

- **Deciphering gene regulatory mechanisms**, with an emphasis on non-coding regulatory elements, their interactions, and their roles in gene expression and disease mechanisms by leveraging large-scale (epi)genomic datasets from [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org) and [ROADMAP](https://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/index.html).
- **Understanding individual-level gene regulation**, particularly focusing on modeling personal gene expression by developing genetic large language models (LLMs) with the use of admixture (e.g., African-American) WGS data in [GTEx](https://gtexportal.org/home/) project.
- **Advancing disease risk assessment** by integrating both rare and <i>de novo</i> variants in biobank-level WGS data from [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) and [MVP](https://www.mvp.va.gov/pwa/) to improve predictive performance and biological interpretability.
