## `Understanding individual-level gene regulation`


Understanding individual gene regulation is key to bridging the gap between regulatory genomics and genetics, providing insight into how genetic variants influence gene expression at a personal level. I develop methods to model both personal gene expression and allele-specific expression by utilizing large language models (LLMs) trained on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, particularly from admixed populations such as African-Americans within the GTEx project. Admixed WGS data offer an ideal control, allowing the isolation of the effects of different alleles while controlling for other factors like transcription factor binding. By focusing on allele-specific regulation, my work provides a clearer understanding of how genetic variants impact regulatory mechanisms and contribute to disease, with a specific emphasis on individual variability.
