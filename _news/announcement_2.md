It was an absolute honor to celebrate Wing’s 70th birthday with such an inspiring and memorable event. The gathering brought together past and present members of Wong Lab, as well as many colleagues who have been shaped by Wing’s mentorship and vision. Reflecting on this milestone, it’s clear that Wing’s contributions to the fields of statistics, genomics, and computational biology have left an indelible mark on science and our individual journeys.

The talks by former Wong Lab members were a true testament to Wing’s legacy. Each speaker, from various stages of their careers, shared cutting-edge research that spanned diverse areas like statistics genetics, cancer genomics, and systems biology. It was fascinating to see how Wing’s influence has not only guided groundbreaking work but also cultivated a culture of curiosity, rigor, and interdisciplinary collaboration. His mentorship has allowed each of us to pursue innovative ideas while staying grounded in statistical principles.

The event was also an opportunity to reflect on the strong sense of community within the Wong Lab. Former students and postdocs spoke fondly of the supportive and intellectually stimulating environment that Wing fostered. His unwavering commitment to excellence and his ability to challenge us to think deeply have shaped all of our approaches to research and problem-solving.

Wing, your mentorship has been an invaluable gift to all of us, and we are incredibly grateful for the wisdom and guidance you’ve shared over the years. Your passion for discovery, your humility, and your dedication to training the next generation of scientists have made a lasting impact on our lives and the broader scientific community.

Here’s to celebrating not only your remarkable career but also the future breakthroughs and collaborations inspired by your teachings. We look forward to seeing what lies ahead for Wong Lab alumni and how your influence will continue to shape the future of science.

Happy 70th Birthday, Wing!
